### Smart Card Engineer (R & D Team Department)
 #### Beta QC Engineer (OCT 2016 - Feb 2017)
  - Conducted direct online testing using handset to validate smart card functionality and performance.
  - Verified the implementation of smart card technology at the final stage to ensure compliance with project goals and industry standards.
  - Developed and executed test plans, test cases, and test scripts for smart card functionality, security, and performance.
  - Conducted regression testing to ensure that new features and enhancements did not adversely affect existing functionality.
  - Documented and reported defects using a report.docx.

 #### Alpha QC Engineer (Feb 2017 - DEC 2018)
  - Conducted offline testing of smart card products using test scripts to ensure functionality and reliability.
  - Develop test plans and test cases for smart card testing based on industry standards, such as ISO/IEC 7816, 3GPP, ETSI.
  - Conducted security and performance testing of smart cards, including but not limited : Performance test, cryptography algorithms such as DES, AES and RSA.
  - Execute test cases using automated and manual testing techniques, including scripting and test automation tools.
  - Analyze test results and report defects to the development team for resolution.
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including smart card developers, project managers, Business Analys to ensure the quality and reliability of the smart card products.
  - Tech stack : Smart Card (Native, Java Card), SIM 900, Card Reader, languange : C++, C#, Java

The key difference is that as a Beta QC Engineer, you conducted direct online testing using handsets, while as an Alpha QC Engineer, you focused on offline testing using scripts.

I try to Mapping All progress that I learn : https://github.com/DianPermana/Smart-Card-History-In-Indonesia/blob/main/3GPP%20TS%2011.11%20V8.14.0%20(2007-06)%20Dian%20Permana.xlsx

## Research \& Development
- Read SMS on SIMCard using C# : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ro63PwuyWk
- Calling other Number via AT-Command using SIM-900
- Now in 2024 I have integrated Reporting with allure report for smart Card testing using python, detail can be check here : [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-PGLNGPDn5_7h3M-lxxbf_OvYFgAWiz_](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-PGLNGPDn5_7h3M-lxxbf_OvYFgAWiz_&si=7NUI6jlOeUGQtckR)

## Learn From CIPTA
- Learning by doing, Learning from sharing, Make it simple, Making history
- Testing is the comparison of results VS expectations.
- Flow proccess SmartCard Development Life Cycle should be clear based on Organization, yes Agility is important but without clear flow everyhing will crash
- The flow of process testing in the SmartCard Development Life Cycle should be conducted starting from how data is stored in memory, particularly in smart cards where data is in Transparent, Linear Fixed, and Cycle formats. This is one of the fundamental aspects of how data is stored. In different systems like databases, there are agents or protocols that connect the application level with the database, hence testing is necessary.
- This tools is awesome, I will help you to contact mas seno if your company need it (just ping me)

## Thank You
Hopefully the knowledge gained will be useful and contribute to building Indonesia's golden generation in 2045.

Thank you,
